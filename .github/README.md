# SKARM

A modern issue tracker for teams that plan, track, and ship together. Multi-tenant workspaces, real-time boards, B2B billing, an AI agent, a dependency graph, and two-way GitHub + Figma sync, built with Next.js 16, Convex, and Clerk.

## FEATURES

### ISSUES AND BOARDS

- Full issue tracking: statuses, five priority levels, assignees, estimates, due dates, labels
- Team-scoped issue keys (`ENG-42`, `DESIGN-7`) with per-team sequences
- Kanban board with drag and drop (@dnd-kit) and fractional sort ordering; moves sync to all clients instantly
- Full-text search over issue titles AND descriptions, with search bars on the issues list and board views showing why a result matched
- Issue templates per team (prefilled title, description, priority, labels) and recurring issues: rituals like weekly standups created automatically on a daily/weekdays/weekly/monthly cadence
- Duplicate warning at creation: typing a title live-searches the whole workspace and surfaces similar issues before you file a twin
- Built to scale: cursor-paginated issue queries (auto-loading list, per-column board pagination) and CSS content-visibility virtualization keep 10k-issue orgs fast
- My Issues dashboard on the workspace home: assigned to you grouped by status, created by you, with a closed-issues toggle
- Command palette (Cmd+K) and single-key shortcuts

### COLLABORATION

- Comments with @mentions, emoji reactions (👍 ❤️ 😄 🎉 👀 🚀 with who-reacted tooltips), one-level reply threads, and a full activity feed per issue
- Inbox with tabs (All / Mentions / Assigned / Status / GitHub), unread counts per tab, and a live unread badge in the sidebar
- Notification preferences: per-channel switches (mentions, assignments, status changes, GitHub activity) enforced at the single server-side notification choke point
- Email digests via AWS SES: each member picks morning/evening delivery, daily/weekly/custom weekdays, and content sections (assigned, in progress, mentions, needs-focus); empty digests are skipped and delivery follows the member's local timezone
- Sub-issues and issue relations (blocks, blocked by, related, duplicate of)
- File attachments via Convex storage
- Live presence: see who is viewing the same issue
- Public issue sharing: read-only links with an OG preview card for unfurls and print-to-PDF export; revocable instantly

### PROJECTS AND CYCLES

- Projects group issues across teams with statuses, leads, target dates, and live progress
- Cycles are time-boxed sprints per team, auto-numbered with current-cycle tracking
- Cycle analytics: burndown chart with ideal guideline, velocity across recent cycles, and scope-change tracking (added/removed points), reconstructed from the activity log
- Dependency graph: a React Flow canvas mapping a project or cycle's issues as nodes with their blocks/related/duplicate relations as directed edges; drag issues in, draw links, auto-arrange by blocking depth, and layouts persist per scope
- Unlimited teams per organization, each with its own board and cycles

### INTEGRATIONS

**GitHub** (GitHub App, per-org OAuth-style install)

- One-click connect: users pick repositories on GitHub's install screen; the repo list is pulled from the API, no manual webhook setup per workspace
- Projects connect one or more repos (live-fetched picker with Public/Private badges, shows who connected)
- "Also create this issue on GitHub" at creation; edits, status changes, and attachments mirror to the GitHub twin (merged PR → Done closes it)
- Two-way sync: editing, closing/reopening, or commenting on the linked GitHub issue reflects back into Meherah; bot echoes are filtered to avoid loops
- PRs link to issues via `ENG-42` in branch names, titles, or bodies; opened PRs move issues to In Review, merged PRs to Done
- All automated events appear in the timeline and inbox as a dedicated GitHub system actor, never as a user

**Figma** (OAuth, granular scopes)

- Connect once per workspace; attach designs to issues by pasting a Figma link (or it auto-detects figma.com URLs in descriptions and comments)
- Live preview: design name, rendered thumbnail, and an "edited Xh ago" freshness stamp fetched via the Figma REST API
- Post issue comments to the linked design; frame links push a "ENG-42 · Status · Title" resource into Figma Dev Mode that links back and stays in sync

### AI AGENT (PRO AND ENTERPRISE)

- Workspace-aware chat with org-scoped tools: create, update, and search issues, summarize cycles, report project status
- AI issue drafting: one-line idea → full spec with acceptance criteria, priority, estimate, labels, sub-issues, and relations to real existing issues - with prompt guidance, length control (short → thorough), rephrase, and discard
- Duplicate detection via 4096-dim vector embeddings (NVIDIA NV-Embed) on every issue
- Triage assist: AI-suggested priority and labels for new issues
- Chat and drafting share one allowance: 50 messages/user/day on Pro, unlimited on Enterprise

### BILLING AND MULTI-TENANCY

- Every workspace is a Clerk organization; users, memberships, and subscriptions sync to Convex via Svix-verified webhooks
- Clerk B2B billing handles checkout, plan changes, and invoices
- Two-layer plan gating: `has({ plan })` in the UI is cosmetic, Convex mutations are the real enforcement
- Free-tier limits (seats, projects, issues) enforced server-side with upgrade prompts in the UI

Key concepts:

- `orgQuery` / `orgMutation` wrappers resolve the user, org, and membership from the Clerk JWT and enforce org scoping on every Convex function (the Convex answer to RLS)
- Clerk is the source of truth: `users`, `organizations`, and `members` tables are only written by webhooks
- Route groups: `(marketing)` is the public site, `(app)/[orgSlug]` is the authenticated workspace
- `proxy.ts` replaces `middleware.ts` in Next.js 16 for route protection

## GETTING STARTED

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev   # runs Next.js and Convex in parallel
```

Full setup lives in [`.docs/CONFIGURE.md`](../.docs/CONFIGURE.md):

- **App setup** - `.env.local`, Clerk (JWT template, billing plans, webhooks), Convex env vars, deployment, and a troubleshooting table
- **GitHub integration** - creating the GitHub App (webhook + setup URLs, permissions), `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` / `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` (base64) env vars, and how the install → webhook → sync flow works
- **Figma integration** - creating the Figma OAuth app (redirect URI, granular scopes) and the `FIGMA_CLIENT_ID` / `FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars
- **Email digests** - SES SMTP env vars (`SES_SMTP_USER/PASSWORD/HOST`, `SES_FROM_EMAIL`, `APP_URL`), sandbox caveats, and the hourly delivery sweep
- **AI models** - where the chat + embedding models live (`convex/agent/models.ts`) and the vector-index dimension rule for swapping embedding models

Once configured: open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign up, create an organization, and you are in.
